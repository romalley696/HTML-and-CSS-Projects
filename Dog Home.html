					<p>Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. <br>
					The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns.<br>
					The almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expression'¿an intense gaze, the Border's famous 'herding eye', is a breed hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom's most agile, balanced, and durable citizens. The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training.<br>
